                        Dota 2 is a

                        video game developed and published by

                    <p>
                        Dota came to life in the early 2000's as a
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_The_Frozen_Throne"> <b>Warcraft 3</b> </a>
                        mod called Defense of the Ancients or DotA.
                        <br>
                        Many people tried to create other versions of DotA and it became clear that the most popular
                        one would be DotA: Allstars,
                        <br>
                        developed mostly by Steve “Guinsoo” Feak, that would be the
                        main version of DotA going forward.
                        <br>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        After a couple of years, Guinsoo, along with Steve "Pendragon" Mescon who basically built the
                        DotA community hubs,
                        <br>
                        would go on to Riot Games and build League of Legends, leaving control
                        of DotA: Allstars with IceFrog,
                        <br>
                        the mysterious developer who would go on to become the single
                        most influential person in the history of Dota.

                    <p>
                        In 2009 IceFrog revealed he had joined Valve and was working on a project with them,
                        which everyone under the sun instantly realised would be some kind of MOBA,
                        <br>
                        but it wasn’t until 2010 that we first got official word of Dota 2.
                        Valve revealed the game and that it would be released in beta form in 2011.
                        <br>
                        Dota continued to grow at a pretty rapid pace over the next few years,
                        and the tournament scene also continued to evolve.

                        These days Dota remains incredibly popular, and the pro scene is still one of the top esports in the world.

                As mentioned above DOTA stands for Defense Of The Ancients, where an Ancient is a building or structure located in each team’s base.
                The player is in control of one unit known as a Hero.
                <br>
                The game puts a team of five players (5 Heroes) in a battle arena type map versus another team of five players.
                Each team tries to destroy the other team’s Ancient  before the other.
                <br>
                Despite everything that can go on in a match in Dota destroying the other team’s Ancient is really the only goal.
                However, in order to reach the opposing team’s Ancient you have to cross the map,
                <br>
                which in Dota is defined by three lanes (top, mid, and bottom), two forest areas known as Radiant jungle (bottom of map) and Dire jungle (top of map), and a river that bisects the map diagonally.
