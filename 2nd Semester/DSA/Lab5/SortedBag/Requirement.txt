									Lab 5: Binary Search Tree


Implement  in  C++  the  given container(ADT)  using  a  given  representation  and  a binary  search tree  (BST)as  a  data  structure.  
You  are  not  allowed  to  use any container  or  data  structurefrom  STL or from any other library.
Do  not  implement  a  separate  class  for  the binary  search  tree(or  for  the  dynamic  array), implement the container directly!



3.ADT SortedBag
	â€“using  a BST  with  linked  representation  with  dynamic  allocation.
	-If  an element appears multiple times, it will be stored multiple times in the BST.
